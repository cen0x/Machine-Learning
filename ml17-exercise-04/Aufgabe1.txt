The classifier has a weak performance (low AUC value), so it's not good.
That is because the ROC curve has 5 false positives and 5 true positives, which means that there are
many "counterexamples" against the predictive model based on this classifier.
A good classifier would generate a ROC curve which is more vertical than horizontal, meaning that
the y-value of the final point in the ROC curve is significantly higher than its x-value (more true positives than false positives).
