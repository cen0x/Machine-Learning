Exercise 04 for Machine Learning Summer Term 2017

Some hints:
* Make sure that you have maven (mvn) installed
* Fill the gaps in the files src/{main,test}/java/org/kramerlab/ml17/exercise
* You should not modify any files outside of the 'exercise' package
* Every gap throws a "HomeworkTodo" exception, just search for it.
* Before you submit, make sure that your code compiles:
  $ mvn compile
* Your code should pass the tests:
  $ mvn test
* You can (and should) add your own tests
* If you decide to not implement something,
  add a junit @Ignore annotation to the relevant tests.
* There are example datasets in 'datasets/' directory
* Before you submit your solution:
  $ mvn clean
  Then zip the entire directory with your solution, send us the zip:
  $ cd .. # exit this directory, go to the parent directory
  $ zip -r ml17-exercise-04-group-{your_group_number}.zip ml17-exercise-02
* The cleaning command 'mvn clean' is important!
  Make sure you don't send us the 'target/' directory!
